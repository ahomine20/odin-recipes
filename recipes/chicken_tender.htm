    <h2>Description...</h2>

    <p class="tender-p"><h4>These Air Fryer Chicken Tenders offer a healthier, quicker, and less messy way to enjoy a classic comfort food, making them an instant family favorite. The recipe involves coating fresh chicken tenders, traditionally dipped in an egg wash and then a seasoned mixture of panko breadcrumbs and oil, to ensure a crispy texture.</h4></p>


    <p class="tender-p"><h4>The tenders are cooked rapidly in a preheated air fryer, which circulates hot air to achieve a deep-fried crunch without excess oil. The result is a batch of juicy, tender chicken with an incredibly crispy, golden exterior, all achieved in just over 10 minutes of cooking time. They are typically served hot and garnished with parsley, alongside your favorite dipping sauce.</h4></p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul class="tender-ul">
        <li><h4>Cooking spray</h4></li>
        <li><h4>2 Large egg</h4></li>
        <li><h4>1 Cup panko bread crumbs</h4></li>
        <li><h4>4 Tablespoons canola oil</h4></li>
        <li><h4>16 Chicken tenders</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Freshly chopped parsley for garnish</h4></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps...</h2>

    <ol class="tender-ol">
        <li><h4>Gather ingredients.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat basket with cooking spray.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Whisk egg in a small bowl. In another bowl, stir together panko and oil until loose and crumbly.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Dip each chicken tender into egg, allowing excess to drip off. Dip chicken in panko mixture to coat completely. Working in batches if needed.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Arrange chicken in an even layer in the air fryer basket. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Serve hot garnished with freshly chopped parsley.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Enjoy with someone!</h4></li>
