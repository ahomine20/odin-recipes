    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><h4>This recipe offers a unique and flavorful twist on traditional potato salad, bringing the popular "Bang Bang" flavor profile—known for being sweet, spicy, and creamy—to the classic side dish.</p> <p> The dish combines tender, creamy boiled potatoes and hard-cooked eggs with a slightly sweet, spicy, and tangy sauce made from mayonnaise, buttermilk, Sriracha, and Thai chili sauce. The addition of fresh celery provides a desirable cool crunch, resulting in a combination of textures and flavors that is much lighter and more complex than standard mayonnaise-heavy potato salad.</h4></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>8 cups cold water</h4></li>
        <li><h4>2 1/2 pounds waxy potatoes (such as Yukon Gold potatoes), peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces</h4></li>
        <li><h4>2 tablespoons , plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</h4></li>
        <li><h4>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</h4></li>
        <li><h4>3/4 cup mayonnaise</h4></li>
        <li><h4>2 tablespoons whole buttermilk</h4></li>
        <li><h4>2 tablespoons Sriracha chili sauce, plus more for drizzling</h4></li>
        <li><h4>1 tablespoon sweet Thai chili sauce</h4></li>
        <li><h4>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</h4></li>
        <li><h4>4 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and quartered</h4></li>
        <li><h4>1 large celery stalk, finely chopped</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Sliced scallions, on an angle</h4></li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Gather all ingredients.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Bring water, potatoes, and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil in a large Dutch oven or medium pot over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are just fork-tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain potatoes and place in a large bowl; gently toss with butter and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Refrigerate, uncovered, until completely cool, about 45 minutes.</h4></h4></li>

        <li><h4>Stir together mayonnaise, buttermilk, chili sauce, Thai chili sauce, and rice vinegar in a medium bowl until combined.</h4></li>

        <li><h4>Add eggs and celery to potatoes; gently stir mayonnaise mixture into potatoes until well combined; top with scallions and drizzle with Sriracha.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Enjoy with someone!</h4></li>
